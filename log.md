**Today's Progress**: Continued the My Complete Web Developer Course on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** I know some JavaScript already but chose this beginners course so I'm able to really drill home all that I know, plus I enjoy Andrei's teachings and am still learning loads.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
