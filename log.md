# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 23rd September, 2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the My Complete Web Developer Course on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** I know some JavaScript already but chose this beginners course so I'm able to really drill home all that I know, plus I enjoy Andrei's teachings and am still learning loads. Today I finished the DOM Manipulation (Section 12 out of 32). Looking forward to starting the next section tomorrow: Advanced JavaScript.

### Day 2: 24th September, 2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started the Advanced JavaScript section, went over Scope, Ternary Operator & Switch Statements, and some ECMAScript 6.

**Thoughts**: Got my first developer job offer today woohoo so I found it a little hard to focus but I'm glad I still managed to go over a few hours of material.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
