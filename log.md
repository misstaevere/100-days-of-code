# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 23rd September, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued the My Complete Web Developer Course on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** I know some JavaScript already but chose this beginners course so I'm able to really drill home all that I know, plus I enjoy Andrei's teachings and am still learning loads. Today I finished the DOM Manipulation (Section 12 out of 32). Looking forward to starting the next section tomorrow: Advanced JavaScript.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
